                                    Tell Me About Yourself
 You submitted the resume and you waited patiently and finally you got that phone call, and now you got the interview. You're sitting across the table and the hirring manager smiles and asks you the question ''Tell me about Yourself''. And you panic. And you don't know what to do. And you don't know what to say. You start to stutter. And halfway the conversation you say to yourself, ''Ugh! I blew it! Why did I even say that?!'' You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Usually the hiring manager makes up his or her mind in the first three minutes during the interview. Do you make a good impression? 
So today I'm going to share with you from a CEO perspective, from a hiring manager perspective, from an employer perspective, what is the best response to the question ''tell me about yourself''. 
You see, we have interviewed thousands and thousands of potential applicants and I cannot tell you how many times I see people kind of struggle with this question, but however, there are incidents that we are very impressed with the response. This is not theory. We have taken some of the best replies, some of the best responses to this question. I'm going to teach it to you, and by the end of this video you're going to walk away with the exact formula, exactly what do you need to say and how to say it. I'm also going to give you a little script, a little template, so next time when you are asked this question you know exactly what to say. And now let me give you a couple keys first.
    
    Key number one.  When the hiring manager is asking you the question ''tell me about yourself'' they are not actually asking about your whole life story. They're not asking about your parents, your background, and your dog's name, and what kind of cat do you have. It is not about that. So when people hear that question, they think, ''Oh, let me tell you my life story!'' and twenty minutes into it, you have not talked about anything important. So, what they're actually askings is what are you bringing to the table. So from now on, when you hear the question, ''tell me about yourself'', I want you to make the mental switch. That equals what the value could you bring to the company? What problems can you solve for the company? That's what they are asking. And you shouldn't go on and on and on about all your background and all of that. No. Don't do that. 

    Key number two. Be yourself, but be your best self. See, one of the mistakes people make here is they believe in the interview, ''well, I just want to be myself''. Yes, you want to be yourself, but you want to be your best self. You want to be authentic, you don't want to be fake. But it doesn't mean that you just share everything. This is the first time you just sitting across the table from a hiring manager, it's like a date. Right? You're just getting to know each other. This is like a coffee date. So make sure that you present your best self. Leed with your strong foot forward. So when they are asking you the question, everything you share, any statement that you make, you always want to tie it back to wath's in it for them. W-I-I-F-M. What's In It For Them? So let me give you an example. Let's say someone is hiring and you're applying for a social media manager position. And the hiring manager is asking you, ''tell me about yourself''. A typical response, someone might say, ''well, you know, I um, I-I-I grew up with social media, and, um, I've used social media for a long long time, my whole life actually. So I'm very familiar with it. And just about three years ago, I tought to myself, well, maybe I could actually make a living doing this. So I started playing around with it, and, um, take on a couple clients here and there and I've worked with a couple people, uh, and then, you know, I'm planning to get married and my fiance told me, you know, I should get a stable job. So here I am, andm I'm looking for a company that offers good growth potential, good growth opportunity. And this place is not too far from my home. It's good, it's only a ten minute drive.'' You see the problem? Like this, al me me me... It's all bout that person what they need and all of that stuff. Bad idea. Now, how do you feel if you are the hiring manager, when you ask that question, comment below, if that's the answer that you get. So, instead of rambling on about that, about my background and all this stuff, what I want, no. If you turn it into a benefit, what's in it for them, what's in it for the hiring manager, what could you say? I'm giving you a simple formula: 
                Three S. Success (My background is blank, I have doing with success...), Strength (My real strength is...), Situation (Meaning, how does that apply to the position that you're applying)
    ...''Is this what ABC company is looking for?'' You see? At the end you ask a question. Whoever asks a question controls the conversation. So you want to ask a question. And now the hiring manager will be like, ''okey, that's what we're looking for'' or ''no, that's not what we're looking for''. And you got from there just because you are in an interview it doesn't mean that you don't need to sell. 
    The next question you might have is well, then, does that mean that I have to memorize a script of some sort? And the answer is ''absolutely yes''. You don't want to go in unprepared. In fact, you want to write it out, practice it, rehearse it many many times. So when you are in front of that potential hiring manager, you are ready to go. You need to memorize it and say it many many times and repeat it many many times, so it comes across very very natural. The last thing you want is to panic and stutter and you dont't know what to say. -
