My name is Maria Fornea. I am 22 years old and I live in Numbrecht, Nordrhein-Westfalen. In 2020, I graduated from college with a degree in computer science. The college gave me the opportunity not to concentrate on one particular area of ​​the IT-specialty, but to develop in many of its areas. I learned the basics of databases, webprogramming, information security and design. This did not give me the right to call myself an expert in all these areas. Of course not. But it gave me a good basis for my future education. After all, I believe that you can call yourself an expert in your field only if you have an idea about others.
Already during my studies, I realized that I should give preference to web design. 
After all, it is in this direction that I can turn my negative qualities into qualities without which a good web designer cannot achieve success. One of these major flaws is perfectionism. I put a lot of emphasis on the little things that might seem meaningless to others. But you must admit, it is precisely such trifles that were not brought to the ideal in time that irritate users and customers most of all. 
Too bright color or the wrong combination of colors, outdated font and insufficiently good image quality, you should also not forget about the page code itself, which can be written correctly, but will greatly slow down the work itself. It is the perfection of such details that attracts me most in web design. The ability to create a product that will meet all the requirements of the client, even those that he himself did not talk about. 
From this follows my other shortcoming - slowness. In my work, I prefer not just to do everything mechanically. As you know, in the IT world, what was relevant yesterday is not necessarily relevant today. The IT sphere is developing in real time, new standards and technologies are emerging. It is very important for me to take this into account and try to put it into practice. That is why I believe that a good specialist is one who never ceases to comprehend something new in his profession. Now I am getting additional education specifically in the field of web design. Therefore, I believe that I can become exactly the specialist you need. I can contribute to the development of your project and benefit the company. Is this what your company is looking for?
